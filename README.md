## About project

The project is an application for unique tracking and activation of actions when reading special tags and using augmented reality (AR) technology.

The application is written in Flutter using the dart programming language and technologies for building Android applications based on the Flutter framework data stack.

The server and processing logic is written in python using packet data exchange libraries based on TCP/IP requests and REST API requests to a server of the Flask server type.

Communication between the application and the server is carried out through secure request processing channels with token authorization technology and one-way encryption
